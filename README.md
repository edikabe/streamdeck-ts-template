# Mastodon Unread Notifications Displayer

This simple [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/fr/stream-deck) plugin aims to display the number of unread notifications for your Mastodon account.
The key is obviously pushable and will lead you to your instance to see your unread notifications. üòä

Be careful with activating it, I made it verbose...

### On Mac
```
defaults write com.elgato.StreamDeck html_remote_debugging_enabled -bool YES
```

### On Windows
You will need to add a `DWORD html_remote_debugging_enabled` with value `1` in the registry `@ HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Elgato Systems GmbH\StreamDeck`.

## TODO 
* [ ] Stop listening on every letter typed in app config, add debouncing..
* [ ] Create proper icon for the plugin instead of pink background..
* [ ] Add debug mode on plugin properties
* [ ] Publish plugin on Stream Deck store
